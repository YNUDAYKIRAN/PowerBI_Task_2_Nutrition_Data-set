# PowerBI_Task_2_Nutrition_Data-set


🍔 Nutrition Analysis of Menu Items using Power BI
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the nutritional content of menu items using Power BI, enabling both customers and businesses to make better food decisions.
Consumers today demand transparency in food nutrition. By analyzing calories, fat, sugars, protein, and sodium levels across menu categories (Breakfast, Burgers, Chicken & Fish, Beverages, Desserts, Salads, etc.), this project provides data-driven insights to guide healthier eating and smarter business strategies.

🎯 Objectives
Highest/Lowest Nutrients → Identify items with extreme values in calories, fat, sodium, and protein.
Unhealthy Elements → Highlight foods with high sugar and trans fat.
Better Choices → Suggest healthier menu alternatives.
Ingredient Impact → Compare bacon/sausage vs egg/chicken items to show nutritional differences.

📂 Dataset
Source: Menu.csv (McDonald’s Menu Dataset)
Size: 260 rows × 24 columns
Categories: Breakfast, Burgers, Chicken & Fish, Salads, Snacks & Sides, Beverages, Desserts & Shakes, Coffee & Tea, Smoothies & Shakes

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Power BI → Dashboard design & visualization
Excel/CSV → Dataset preprocessing

📊 Methodology
Imported and cleaned dataset in Power BI
Ensured correct data types and checked for missing values
Designed interactive dashboards with DAX measures and conditional formatting
Conducted deep dive analysis into calorie distribution, sugar content, and protein balance

🔍 Key Insights
High-Calorie Items → Chicken McNuggets (40 pcs) – 1880 kcal
Healthier Options → Apple Slices, Egg White Delight McMuffin, Side Salad
Unhealthy Elements → McFlurry, Shakes & Frappés (extremely high sugar), Double Quarter Pounder (high trans fat)
Ingredient Impact →
Bacon/Sausage items = 25–40% higher fat and sodium
Egg/Chicken items = higher protein, fewer calories

📖 Storytelling with Data (Client View)
The Problem: Customers struggle to make healthy choices from large menus.
The Data Story:
A Big Breakfast with Hotcakes packs over 1000 kcal and 56g fat, while Apple Slices have just 50 kcal.
Drinks like McFlurry with M&M’s contain 90g+ sugar — nearly 4x daily limit.
Switching from sausage/bacon to chicken/egg reduces fat & sodium significantly while boosting protein.

The Customer Story:
Parents choosing for kids → Replacing Hotcakes & Sausage with Egg McMuffin + Apple Slices ensures a healthier, balanced meal.
Office-goers → Choosing Grilled Chicken Salad instead of Double Quarter Pounder avoids fatigue and improves satisfaction.

Business Value:
Highlight healthy options with menu badges 🥗
Create balanced meal combos (main dish + side salad/fruit)
Promote protein-rich options (egg/chicken) in marketing campaigns
Use insights to design data-driven menus → improves customer trust & brand image
